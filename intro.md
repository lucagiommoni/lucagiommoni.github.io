Hey there!

I am Luca an electronic and computer engineer. I got my graduations in Italy – Bachelor’s in Perugia and Master’s in Torino.

I worked in some of the main markets starting as a system engineering and cloud architect for a major bank in Italy; then moved to automotive, being a connected feature architect and eventually becoming a global program manager; finally, I am currently working in the container shipping sector, coordinating the program that see the informatic system of the shipping agencies moved to the Cloud.

I am very curious and open to learn new things. I am looking for a company that I can feel like mine, with strong values and worthful people.
