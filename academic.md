### Sept 2016 - March 2017

**Project:** Disaster Recovery Of Linux Systems

**Role:** Computer Engineer

**Company:** <a href="https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/en/" class="text-white-50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intesa Sanpaolo</a>

**Techologies:** VMWare®, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, MongoDB, RabbitMQ

The activity consisted in engineering the process of restarting Linux systems on a datacenter located at a distance greater than 100 KM which, in case of unavailability of primary sites, would ensure the correct operation of IT services in compliance of SLAs. Orchestration workflows were created with VMWare® vRealize Orchestrator technology, implemented using mainly the Javascript programming language. The flows were made in such a way as to recreate the virtual servers exactly as they were on the primary sites, restoring the state with respect of two indicators: Recovery Time Object (RPO) and Recovery Point Object (RPO). The process had to guarantee the restart of a set of critical virtual servers in more than two hours while the remaining part of the virtual servers had to return operating in more than four hours (according to the Banca d’Italia guidelines). RabbitMQ was also used to implement an asynchronous code-based infrastructure. The whole process included, in the various phases, a continuous communication with the CMDB for data reading and writing operations on the status of virtual servers, applications and network services.
