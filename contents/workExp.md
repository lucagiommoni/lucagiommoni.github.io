## Working Experiences

### [MSC Technology](https://www.msctechnology-italy.com/) (2021 - Now)

<br>

#### Cloud Migration Coordinator

With the aim of providing always-on, highly reliable and scalable ERP software to shipping agencies belonging to the Company, I am actively participating in the migration of the software to **Microsoft Azure**. I run the scoping and gap analysis with the agencies,overseeing the overall setup and configuration along with the _maintenance and cost saving_ operations. I am also supervising all the phases from the beginning to the conclusion of each migration project, working strictly with product owners, scrum teams and the agency members to get deliverables done within the preset milestones.

<br>

#### DevOps & Automations

Keeping software updated on all agencies around the world is a particularly important task along with advocating high availability and reliability features. In this sense, automation provides great enhancement and support. Hence, I am actively involved in this process to keep an elevated level of automation using software and tools like **Ansible** with **Azure DevOps** pipeline to run automatic flow for updates and hot fix. My team is leading this transition to full automation working tightly with the technology offered by cloud providers like **Microsoft Azure**.

<br>

#### L3 Application Support Management

I lead a team that oversees the assessment and the addressing of major L3 incidents related to the in-house developed ERP product used by the MSC shipping agencies all over the world. We also manage new implementations requests and product improvements, collaborating with functional, development and testing teams. When a major incident, an improvement or a new request comes, I interface with functional team for process validation and approval and, after that, I design the technical solution.

### [Teoresi S.p.A.](http://www.teoresigroup.com/) – [Stellantis NV](https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/Pages/home.aspx) (2019 - 2020)

<br>

#### E2E Feature Design and Integration

I was involved in the design ofthe new features (e.g., vehicle behaviors controlled via smartphone) that would be eventually deployed on the new connected vehicles generation. The implementation was done on **AWS Cloud** environment and consumed by vehicles through specific protocols. I also collaborated with ICT and Cyber Security teams but also with technology providers for the integration of external modules. I was responsible for ensuring the architecture was compliant with general countries regulations along with the best security and automotive practices.

<br>

#### Global Program Manager

<br>

##### Connectivity Program for Connected Vehicles 

I managed the connectivity program that involved all the new generation vehicles that would implement new electrical and connectivity technology. The team was distributed among different countries like USA, China and India. I strictly collaborated with project managers and technology providers. I also participate in the management of DevOps, test and validation processes with related teams for the compliance of countries regulations and automotive best practices. My main responsibility was to coordinate project managers and technical teams to deliver new hardware/software on all the old and brand-new connected vehicles of the company group.

<br>

##### Over-The-Air (xOTA)

Regarding firmware/software updates, I coordinated the program concerning the Over-The-Air Technology with which updates were executed. My role was to discuss the delivery of new updates with the suppliers and the internal teams concerned and create the delivery plan for each vehicle line, the setup of the devices within the vehicle (i.e., Radio) and the update campaigns. As a program manager I also supervised backend and onboard tests to ensure the respect of the milestones.

<br><br>

### [Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.](https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/en/) (2016 - 2019)

<br>

#### Disaster Recovery (DR)

The activity consisted in engineering the process of restarting **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** systems on a datacenter located at a distance greater than 100 KM which, in case of unavailability of primary sites, would ensure the correct operation of IT services in compliance of SLAs (Service Level Agreements). 

Orchestration workflows were created with **VMWare® vRealize Orchestrator** technology, implemented using mainly the **JavaScript** programming language. The flows were made in such a way as to recreate the virtual servers exactly as they were on the primary sites, restoring the state with respect of two indicators: Recovery Time Object (RTO) and Recovery Point Object (RPO). 

The process had to guarantee the restart of a set of critical virtual servers in more than two hours while the remaining part of the virtual servers had to return operating in more than four hours (according to the [CEB guidelines](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/internal-governance/guidelines-on-ict-and-security-risk-management)).

<br>

#### Private Cloud Design and Management

During this time, I was responsible with my team to design and maintain the private cloud hosted within the company datacenter. I was involved in the design phase of the orchestration flows to manage the IT resources lifecycle, working with tools like HP® Operations Orchestration software and VMWare® vRealize Orchestrator technology. I also received requests for new services to be delivered via the cloud platform like:

- Virtual servers, Linux and Windows

- Microservices via OpenShift platform

- Network load balancer roles via F5

- Database SQL server, Oracle e MongoDB

- Extension of CPU/RAM/DISKS of virtual server

- POC Linux and Windows

- PaaS WebLogic, Jboss, IIB, Apache, MQ

- LUN

- Share CIFS and NFS

So, I collaborated with different team (Networking, Microsoft, Linux, Storage, …) to design and set up the service that would be delivered and used through the cloud.

<br>

#### Public Cloud Design and Migration

This project was aimed at designing an IT topology into a public cloud platform to host most of the company software applications that would then be migrated. I started identifying all the requirements and running the gap analysis. Then, my team and I built all the automation flow and started to build the hybrid solution to be integrated with the existing on-premises private cloud. We also made some POC with different cloud providers like **AWS**, **Microsoft Azure** and **Google GCP** to choose the one that allowed more compliance with the general and internal regulation. So, I oversaw designing and managing new tailored services built within the public cloud (MS Azure) in production and non-production environments. Finally, my team and I developed the POC to allow multi-cloud integration through **HashiCorp Terraform** technology.

<br>

#### Cloud Monitoring Tool

Within the Cloud project, I was responsible for a project’s stream aimed at designing and managing a micro-services framework for the proactive monitoring and prevention of failures on the Cloud infrastructure to drastically reduce the incident number. I mainly worked with orchestrators and configuration management tools like **Ansible**.

<br>

#### Relationship with customers and suppliers

Following the purpose of Cloud near-to-zero problems, I became responsible for a project’s stream for the proactive monitoring and prevention of failures on the Cloud infrastructure, designed and implemented with a micro-services framework.
