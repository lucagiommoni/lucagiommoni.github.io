## About Me

<hr class="border-light my-4" />

Hello,

I am Luca, a computer engineer with <span id="yow"></span> years' experience in IT companies. Over the last years, I have gained extensive experience in the field of Cloud Computing and DevOps. 

I started my career in Intesa Sanpaolo, working on the Disaster Recovery project. Then, as a Cloud Architect, I designed and implemented private/hybrid/public cloud solutions, ensuring that they met the business requirements and were aligned with the company's IT strategy. 

After that, I worked as Connected Feature Architect and Program Manager at Stellantis, where at the beginning was responsible for designing the new connected features that would eventually be implemented on new vehicles. Afterwards, I began managing connectivity programs, with a particular emphasis on xOTA (updates over-the-air) projects. During my time at Stellantis, I gained valuable experience in DevOps processes and in managing complex projects involving multiple stakeholders, coordinating resources and timelines, and ensuring that projects were delivered on time and within budget.

Currently, I am working as a Cloud Coordinator and L3 Application Support Specialist at MSC Technology, where I am responsible for the migration of the company's IT infrastructure to the Azure cloud platform and leading a 10 people team for the L3 application support management. In MSC, I have demonstrated my ability to work with cross-functional teams, manage multiple projects simultaneously, and drive results through effective leadership and collaboration. I also enforced valuable experience on Cloud technology and DevOps processes.
I am confident that my experience and skills make me a strong fit for this role. I am excited about the prospect of working for an innovative company that values modern technologies and approaches to work.
