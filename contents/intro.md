## About Me

<hr class="border-light my-4" />

Hello,

I am Luca, a computer engineer with <span id="yow"></span> years' experience in IT companies. Over the last years, I have gained extensive technical experience in the ICT market working on Cloud Computing and DevOps, but also managing teams and big projects.

I started my career in **Intesa Sanpaolo**, working on the _**Disaster Recovery**_ project. Then, as a _**Cloud Architect**_, I designed and implemented cloud solutions, ensuring that they met the business requirements and were aligned with the company strategy.I was also responsible for a group of external consultants for support and operation projects. After that, I moved to Stellantis to work on _**Connected Features**_ projects. Here I initially worked as _**Feature Design Architect**_, then covering the role of _**Program Manager**_. Hence, I managed connectivity programs, with a particular emphasis on _**xOTA**_ (updates over-the-air) projects. During my time at Stellantis, I gained valuable experience in managing complex projects that involved multiple stakeholders, external providers and big teams. I learned how to coordinate teams and to ensure projects were delivered on time and within budget. Currently, I am working as a _**Cloud Migration Coordinator**_ and _**L3 Application Support Specialist**_ at **MSC Technology**. I am responsible for the migration of the company's IT infrastructure to the **Azure** cloud platform and leading a 10-person team for the L3 application support management. In MSC, I have demonstrated my ability to work with cross-functional teams, manage multiple projects simultaneously, and drive results through effective leadership and collaboration. I also enforced valuable experience on Cloud technology and DevOps processes while gaining more management skills. 

Thanks for surfing my profile

Sincerely,
Luca
