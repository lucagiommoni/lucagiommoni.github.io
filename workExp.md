#### Issues and Improvements Solution Architect 

I oversee the assessment and the addressing of major incidents related to the in-house developed ERP product used by the MSC shipping agencies all over the world. I also manage new implementations requests and product improvements, collaborating with functional, development and testing teams. When an major incident, an improvement or a new request comes, I interface with functional team for process validation and approval and, after that, I design the technical solution.

#### Cloud Migration Coordinator 

With the aim to provide an always-on, high reliable and scalable ERP software to shipping agencies belonging to the Company, I am actively participating in the migration of the on-premises software version to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. I run the scoping and gap analysis with the agencies to check what are the needs to allow the specific agency software to be migrated to the Cloud. I am also overseeing the Cloud environment setup and configuration along with the maintenance and cost saving operations. I am also providing remote and on-site (agency locations all over the world) prerequisites collection and support, supervising all the phases from the beginning to the conclusion of each migration project, working strictly with product owners, scrum teams and the agency members to get deliverables done within the preset milestones. 

<br>

#### Automations 

Keeping software updated on all agencies around the world is a particularly important task along with advocating high availability and reliability features. In this sense, automation provides great enhancement and support. So, I am actively involved in this process to keep an elevated level of automation using software and tools like Ansible with Azure DevOps pipeline to run automatic flow for updates and hot fix. My team is leading this transition to full automation working tightly with the technology offered by cloud providers like MS Azure.

### Jan 2020 – Oct 2021

**Project:** PHEV, MEV, BEV & Connected Vehicles

**Role:** Global Project Manager for Connected Vehicle

**Company:** <a href="http://www.teoresigroup.com/" class="text-white-50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Teoresi S.p.A. &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a> - <a href="https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/Pages/home.aspx" class="text-white-50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a>

I take care of organizing and scheduling the development, validation and release of the electric vehicle features on a global level (EMEA, NA, APAC, LATAM). I work with reliability teams and create cross-functional links between problem solving teams. In addition, I deal with the discovery of the technical and functional requirements for the implementation of changes in the feature plan by collaborating with the various teams.

### May 2019 – Dec 2019

**Project:** PHEV, MEV, BEV & Connected Vehicles

**Role:** Feature Design & Integration

**Company:** <a href="http://www.teoresigroup.com/" class="text-white-50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Teoresi S.p.A. &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a> - <a href="https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/Pages/home.aspx" class="text-white-50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" >Fiat Chrysler Automobiles &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a>

I manage the design and integration of new feature with the existing platform, in the project of connected vehicle. In particular I am involved in feature like Map-Over-The-Air (MOTA) which exploits delta technology to update maps for integrated navigator, Service Provisioning for managing services and app within the connected units and Application-Over-The-Air (AOTA) responsible for updating app and services within connected vehicle.

### Sept 2018 - April 2019

**Project:** Automation services: delivery and migration of technological resources on a public cloud

**Role:** Cloud Architect

**Company:** <a href="https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/en/" class="text-white-50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intesa Sanpaolo</a>

**Techologies:** Microfocus CSA e HPOO, GIT, Javascript, NodeJS, Docker, GraphQL, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ansible, VMWare, Microsoft PowerBI, Terraform, GO Lang, Microsoft Azure

Automation of the delivery of technological resources provided by a public cloud service provider (CSP) in production and non-production environments, through an internal cloud portal. The activity consisted in creating a software infrastructure that allowed to create / modify / release technological resources in the cloud paradigm (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) on datacenters of a provider outside the company such as Microsoft Azure. A framework was created that, exploiting REST architecture, receives a JSON payload as input and, implementing logic, written in GO Lang, configures resources on the cloud service provider through Hashicorp Terraform technology. We also followed outsourcing processes of technological components, critical for the proper operations of information systems in the cloud, such as Active Directory and Domain Controller, in compliance with the terms of compliance and security imposed by the European Central Bank (ECB).

### April 2017 - August 2018

**Project:** Automation services for the delivery of IT resources via private cloud

**Role:** Cloud Architect

**Company:** <a href="https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/en/" class="text-white-50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intesa Sanpaolo &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a>

**Techologies:** Microfocus CSA e HPOO, JSP, GIT, Javascript, NodeJS, Docker, GraphQL, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ansible, VMWare, Microsoft PowerBI

The activity consisted of creating automation services for the delivery of IT resources through the private cloud portal, created through the Microfocus product, Cloud Service Automation (CSA). Automations were created for the creation/modification/de-allocation of resources such as:

- Virtual servers, Linux and Windows

- Microservices via OpenShift platform

- Network load balancer roles via F5

- Database SQL server, Oracle e MongoDB

- Extension of CPU/RAM/DISKS of virtual server

- POC Linux and Windows

- PaaS WebLogic, Jboss, IIB, Apache, MQ

- LUN

- Share CIFS and NFS

The private Cloud, structured on three layers, needs:

- Design of the front end of the single service with management of the life cycle of the request (management and use of the Microfocus CSA portal and management of information via JSP / Javascript / T-SQL)

- Workflows design for top level orchestrator (Microfocus HPOO technology) for
    
    - Resource census on CMDB
    
    - Technological provider execution and monitoring
    
    - Error management and ticketing

- Design of payloads and workflows of the various technology providers (second level orchestrators, schedulers and Configuration Management Tools) responsible for the creation / modification / de-allocation of technological resources.

As a last step, a framework was created to support the IT delivery via cloud for the proactive monitoring and prevention of failures related to outages of technology providers such as Microsoft Orchestrator, Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat Ansible servers, VMWare VRO server, CMDB etc. The framework was born on a microservice architecture (Docker) in which each microservice implemented an active control on the technologies and, in the event of detected malfunction, activated a queue for requests made by users on the cloud portal. This queue was then emptied when the malfunction was solved, avoiding redundant generations of tickets and failures and to guarantee compliance with the SLAs.
